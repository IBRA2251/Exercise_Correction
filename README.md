# Exercise_Correction
Remotely help others even when a trainer is not present. We aim to analyze how trainers perform different exercises and train our models to help 2D stickmen or avatars train them. This program aims to train or help customers exercise by correcting their postures or letting them know if they are moving too fast during an exercise.
